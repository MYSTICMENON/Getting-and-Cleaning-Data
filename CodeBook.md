##read the train, test and feature and activity_lables and assigning different names to respective data row binding the X, Y and subject test and train data and giving variables names

##activity variable shows the different activity done
##subject variable shows the different identification ID
##run_analysis.R  does the following:

## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

## 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## tidydata.txt is the final output of 5. above.
